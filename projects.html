            <h2>Project One: Nebula</h2>
            <p>
              Purpose: Explore and visualize sound using math equations. This
              project uses the computer's microphone to capture sound, and
              applies the sound data to generate dynamic, colorful visual
              patterns in real-time using math equations. It is made up of two
              reactive nebulas that moved based upon the bass and treble.

            <h2>Project Two: Gridiron Guru</h2>
            <p>
              Purpose:Predict NFL game outcomes using machine learning techniques.
               I built a model in Python leveraging Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, 
               applying logistic regression with cross-validation to ensure reliable 
               performance. To optimize results, I developed and trained a scikit-learn
               pipeline that incorporated targeted feature extraction and iterative tuning,
               ultimately achieving a 70% prediction accuracy on recent seasons.

            <h2>Project Three: Hash Guard</h2>
            <p>
              Purpose:I deployed a secure authentication system that utilized salted SHA-512 password 
              hashing to ensure strong protection of user credentials, integrating robust 
              file I/O operations and comprehensive exception handling to maintain system 
              reliability. As this is a back end project, there is no visual component.
